Docker.

Open <http://localhost:5173>. The API is on <http://localhost:3000/api/v1>.

## Migrations

Tables are defined in `backend/src/app/models/`. Change them there, then generate a migration.

```sh
mise run db:dev:migrate:generate add_something   # write SQL from your model changes
mise run db:dev:migrate:up                       # apply pending migrations
mise run db:dev:migrate:status                   # is the database behind?
mise run db:dev:migrate:down                     # undo the latest migration
```

Read the generated SQL before committing it.

`mise run db:dev:studio` opens Prisma Studio on <http://localhost:5555>.
